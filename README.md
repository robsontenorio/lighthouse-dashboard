# Install 

Require the package.

```
composer require robsontenorio/lighthouse-dashboard
```


Publish package assets and config file.

```
php artisan lighthouse-dashboard:publish
```

Configure the package.

```php
// config/lighthouse-dashboard.php

return [
    /**
     * Authenticated user attribute for identify the current client.
     * 
     * If there is no authenticated user a `anonymous` will be used.
     * Default is `Auth::user()->username`
     */

    'client_identifier' => 'username',

    /**
     * Database connection name for the dashboard.
     * 
     * By default it uses different connection. You must create it.
     * Or set it to `null` if want to use same connection from target app.
     */

    'connection' => 'dashboard',
];
```

Run package migrations.

```
php artisan lighthouse-dashboard:migrate
```

Open the dashboard.

```
http://your-app/lighthouse-dashboard
```

To keep the assets up-to-date and avoid issues in future updates, we highly recommend adding the command to the post-autoload-dump section in your `composer.json` file:

```json
{    
    "scripts": {
        "post-autoload-dump": [            
            "@php artisan lighthouse-dashboard:publish-assets"
        ]
    }
}
```

### Note about phpunit tests

This dashboard collects metrics by listening  `Nuwave\Lighthouse\Events\ManipulateResult` . Make sure to disable this on your parent `TestCase`, in order to prevent metrics collecting while testing your app.

```php
use Nuwave\Lighthouse\Events\ManipulateResult;

abstract class TestCase extends BaseTestCase
{    
    // use this Trait
    use DisableDashboardMetrics;

    public  function setUp(): void
    {
        parent::setUp();

        // Then, disable metrics while testing
        $this->withoutDashboardMetrics();
    }
}
```

# How does it works?

<details>
<summary>See more ...<br><br></summary>

This package enables built-in `Tracing` extension from Laravel Lighthouse GraphQL Server. So, every operation automatically is profiled with its execution metrics.

- GraphQL request is made.
- Dashboard listen to `ManipulateResult` event and collect metrics from current operation.
- Metrics are stored on dashboard.

The GraphQL server performance is not affected by this package, once metrics are collect after response is sent by server. You can also disable tracing output from server response. See "Configurations" section.

/config/lighthouse-dashboard.php
```php
return [
    /**
     * Authenticated user attribute for identify the current client.
     * 
     * If there is no authenticated user a `anonymous` will be used.
     * Default is `Auth::user()->username`
     */

    'client_identifier' => 'username',

    /**
     * Database connection name for the dashboard.
     *

     * Or set it to `null` if want to use same connection from target app.
     */

    'connection' => 'dashboard',

    /**

     * This is a required feature to make this package working.     
     * 
     * If you want including tracing output on server response just set it to `false`.
     * 
     */

    'silent_tracing' => true,

    /**
     * Ignore clients.
     * 
     * Ignore all request from these clients based on `client_identifier`.     
     *

```bash
# run once
composer test

# run in watch mode

Once this package includes UI, the only way to see it is by running it through target app.

### Uninstall  

If you previous installed this package, **first uninstall it from target app**.

Remove this entry from `composer.json`.

```json
{    
    "scripts": {
        "post-autoload-dump": [ 
            "@php artisan lighthouse-dashboard:publish-assets"
        ]
    }
}
```

Remove package.

```
composer remove robsontenorio/lighthouse-dashboard
```

Remove package public assets from target app.

```
rm -rf /path/to/app/public/vendor/lighthouse-dashboard
```

### Install locally

Clone the repository, then on target app add to `composer.json`

```json
 "repositories": {
        "robsontenorio/lighthouse-dashboard": {
            "type": "path",
            "url": "/local/path/to/lighthouse-dashboard",
            "options": {
                "symlink": true
            }
        }
    }
```

Require local package version.

```sh
composer require robsontenorio/lighthouse-dashboard @dev
```

Then, create a symlink from package vendor folder to app public assets folder.

```sh
ln -s /path/to/app/vendor/robsontenorio/lighthouse-dashboard/public/vendor/lighthouse-dashboard /path/to/app/public/vendor
```

From this package project folder, install frontend dependencies and start it on dev mode.

```sh
yarn dev
```

Now all assets built inside package vendor folder will be symlinked to target app public vendor folder.

Then point to http://localhost:3000/lighthouse-dashboard/
